P5: The Neighborhood Map
-------------------------

Project Overview :
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

Instructions :
Run the index.html file and navigate through different point of interest in Duluth, MN the city from the season 1 of the tv series FARGO.
Move within the map and click on the markers to have an idea of the places that you can find. Use the filters to focus your interests, and use the sidebar as a navigation bar to receive more detailed news on the POI.
Don't forget to enjoy the experience!
